# CodeLouJSTodo

This is a project to write a to-do list application that can be run in the
browser and will meet the [requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jtlow4tOOvxB0Vas0rOUueD4cEo6nOn5YN8zvItra6g/edit?usp=sharing) for the 2020 CodeLouisville Javascript
course.

The features for the project that I'm aiming to use are:
- Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app
  (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)
- Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
- Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external
  file
- Create 3 or more unit tests for your application (and document how to run
  them)


## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/magikid/CodeLouJSTodo.git
cd CodeLouJSTodo
# open index.html in your browser
```

## Todos

I'm tracking work that still needs to be done on the [Todos board](https://github.com/magikid/CodeLouJSTodo/projects/1).
